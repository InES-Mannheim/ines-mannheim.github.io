  Different tools may have different means to express processes. For example, they might differ in formats and interfaces. From a user perspective this is a rather unsatisfying situation, because processes may span over several systems implying additional manual orchastration effort. The SPA taggles this problem by consuming different interfaces and formats. Thereby, a mapping between the concepts of two formats is provided and, thus, the formats are integrated (cf. ASCII art below).
